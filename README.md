# Daily Performance Tracker

## Overview

This is a personal project that I am building primarily for my own use. The main goal of this project is to help me stay consistent with my daily activities by tracking my performance in a simple, visual, and motivating way.

The idea came from a recurring problem I face: losing motivation to do daily routines and habits. Instead of relying on external apps that don’t fully match my needs, I decided to build my own solution—one that I can improve, customize, and grow alongside my skills as a developer.

While this project starts as a personal web application, I plan to evolve it over time and potentially deploy it as a cross-platform application in the future.

## Project Purpose

The core purpose of this project is to **encourage daily action through consistency and accountability**.

By turning daily activities into a checklist and tracking completion over time, the application aims to:

* Help build positive daily habits
* Reduce reliance on motivation alone
* Provide a clear visual record of daily performance
* Make self-improvement more engaging through light gamification

This project is not meant to be a productivity tool for everyone—at least not initially. It is designed around my own workflow, routines, and challenges, which makes it more meaningful and sustainable for me to use every day.

## How It Works (Concept)

* Users define a set of daily activities
* Each day presents a checklist of those activities
* Activities can be marked as completed or incomplete
* The system tracks daily completion and overall consistency
* Performance data is summarized to show progress over time

On top of basic tracking, the project introduces **gamification elements** to reinforce positive behavior rather than punish missed days.

## Gamification Approach

The gamification system is intentionally simple and supportive. The goal is not pressure, but encouragement.

Planned ideas include:

* Daily completion streaks
* Points or experience gained per completed activity
* Levels or milestones based on consistency
* Simple achievements (e.g., 7-day streak, first full day completed)

These features are designed to reward progress and consistency, even if perfection isn’t achieved every day.

## Why I Built This

I often struggle with staying motivated to complete daily routines, even when I know they are beneficial. This project is my attempt to solve that problem by:

* Creating something I will actually use
* Holding myself accountable through visible progress
* Practicing discipline both as a user and as a developer

At the same time, this project serves as a learning experience where I can apply and improve my skills in:

* Frontend and backend development
* State management and data persistence
* UI/UX design focused on habit-building
* Incremental feature development

## Current Status

This project is currently under active development.

The focus right now is on:

* Building a clean and functional MVP
* Keeping the scope manageable
* Ensuring the app is usable on a daily basis

More advanced features and cross-platform deployment will be considered once the core experience is stable and proven useful.

---

## Future Plans

Potential future improvements include:

* Cross-platform support (mobile and desktop)
* Data visualization (charts, streak history, summaries)
* Customizable activity weights or priorities
* Cloud sync and backups
* Authentication (if expanded beyond personal use)

These features will be added gradually based on actual usage and necessity, not just ideas.

## Disclaimer

This is a personal project built for self-improvement and learning. While others are welcome to explore, fork, or adapt it, the design decisions primarily reflect my own needs and goals.
